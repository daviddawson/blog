## Learn Microservices with David Dawson

### Day 1 - Architecture & Design for Simplicity and Antifragility:

* Introducing Antifragile Software and Simplicity
* Defining Microservices in term of their Principles, Benefits and Challenges
* Understand and explore the forces (stressors) of change on software
* Applying Simplicity, with O.R.E.
* Architecting and Designing for Software System Evolution with the Life Preserver tool
