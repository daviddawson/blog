## Reactive Microservices - 3 day workshop

Microservices have become the goto architecture for building systems that scale, operate natively in the cloud and give you a competitive advantage.

These are the promises, what are the practices that make them real?

This is a 3 day workshop that will teach you the principles of microservices, and give you the tools and techniques to build, manage and deploy them into production effectively.

I can also deliver this online/ remotely using the Adaptive Learning method managed by link:https://adaptos.net/effective-technology/courses/adopting-reactive-microservices/[Adaptos]

## Synopsis

* Understanding why microservices
* How to decompose an existing system and then recompose it into something valuable.
* Microservices composition using messaging
* Microservices composition using events
* Handing complex state using Event Sourcing
* Complex transactional event systems using Process Managers
* Service patterns: Gateways, Adapters, Pipelines, Choreography
* Continuous Delivery of Microservices
* Applying practical Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
