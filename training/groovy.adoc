## Groovy 2/3 day Onsite course

Groovy is a lovely language on the JVM with a syntax that is easy on the eyes
and a distinct focus on building practical, pragmatic software.

I will come to your office and deliver a 2 or 3 day introduction to Groovy that you can
use to get started with the language and technologies.

I can also deliver this online/ remotely using the Adaptive Learning method managed by link:https://adaptos.net/effective-technology/courses/groovy-intro[Adaptos]

## Synopsis
