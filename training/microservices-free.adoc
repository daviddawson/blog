## Microservices Healthcheck

So, you've gone all in on Microservices, yet you find yourself feeling pain you didn't expect...  Are you doing it right?

I've had this question often enough that I've decided to offer a specialised healthcheck for new clients.

The outcome you can expect is :-

* An understanding of the principles of Microservices
* What you _should_ expect your microservice system to deliver
* What the _expected costs_ of a Microservice system
* How your systems and processes match up against industry best practices

Its a *free session*, subject to availability and convenient timing. The format is :

* 1 hour long
* Delivery is remote, via video conferencing software
* Senior stakeholders in the room.
* Standard questions sent by me via email before hand.
* We then discuss them, ascertaining project health in the various areas covered.

Once thats done, I will send a brief report on project health back to you, along with a set of suggestions for you to take
your system/ project forward with.

There is no obligation to ue my services to do that with.
