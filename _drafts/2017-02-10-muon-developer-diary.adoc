I'm going to be writing regular updates on what we are doing in the Muon project and highlighting different areas of the projects. I'll try to keep this weekly, but we'll see how that goes!

In this inaugural post, I give an overview of the projects and how they fit together.

Read the intro blog post here

The projects can be split up into *Muon Implementations*, *Muon Plugins* and *Services built with Muon*

## Muon Projects

* link:http://muoncore.io/submodules/java/doc/[Muon CLI] - The CLI interface to Muon systems.
* link:http://muoncore.io/submodules/java/doc/[Muon Java] - Java implementation. First built and generally the place things are experimented with first.
* link:http://muoncore.io/submodules/node/doc/index.html[Muon Node] - Node implementation of Muon
* http://muoncore.io/submodules/clojure/doc/index.html[Muon Clojure] - Clojure wrapper around Muon Java.
* http://muoncore.io/submodules/muonjs/doc/index.html[MuonJs] - Muon running in the browser.
* https://github.com/muoncore/libmuon[libMuon] - C++ implementation of Muon, highly experimental.

## Muon Plugins

Given the aggressively polyglot nature of Muon, we have to find a way to avoid the _matrix effect_ of having extensions and an arbitrary number of Muon implementations. We're handling this by defining APIs to allow us to build most implementations in C++ and have a method for integrating into the three major Muon environments. This will cover Discovery and Transport plugins. Protocols will be handled by the upcoming Muon Protocol Language.

* link:https://github.com/muoncore/transport-websocket[Websocket Transport Native Plugin]. Experiments in building cross language plugins.

Expect many more of these when the native build pipeline is completed.

## Services built with Muon

* link:http://muoncore.io/submodules/photon/docs/index.html[Photon] - an advanced event store
* link:http://muoncore.io/submodules/aether/docs/index.html[Aether] - Identity management facade for Muon systems.
* link:http://muoncore.io/submodules/muonjs-gateway/doc/index.html[Muonjs Gateway] - allow Muon systems in the browser to connect to server side via a transport level message router.

This is a quick overview of the current projects. There's lots in flight, more next week!
