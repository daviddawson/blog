How do you fund your software projects?  Go and get a large budget from the board? 

If you are currently deciding how much capex to allocate to "going microservices". This article is for you!

## Capex for the uninitiated

Capital expenditure budgets are a peculiar beast. The process looks something like this.

* we have something that we need doing.
* lets scope out the work involved, and come up with a budget that should cover creating it.
* we form a project, and a project team to deliver the thing we want,  using the budget.
* the board expect regular updates telling them how things are going and what the current risks are.
*when the project budget ends, everything stops.

The benefits to the organisation are in containing financial risk to the currently allocated budget, often tax benefits from 'investing'. The company filings commonly don't include capex in the same manner as simple operational expenses, so the board can claim that the company is spending less money than you would expect looking at the simple numbers.

Overall, it makes a lot of sense from a high level view to allocate capex to getting things done in a large company.  

So what's the problem?

Well, what are your motivationsfor adopting microservices?

Broadly, you are looking at adopting microservicrs because you want to change things. Either taking advantage of public cloud scaling, migrating from a legacy system, scaling your teams. The specifics are myriad,  yet the core premise is the same. You want to change.

*Capex funding will work against this agenda.*

Capex funding has some significant effects that are a significant barrier to successful adoption of microservices such that they will give you the benefits.

## Effect of teams
Teams. Too mich reliance on contractors. Who naturally fit the capex model. They cak, aftwr all, be hiref and fired as needed without recourse.

## Effect on software infrastructure
Infrastructure. Cloud is an opex model.
The essence of change is tjat you don't know up front how things will look at the end. So you can't effectively predict tje final costs.

Using capex will mean that the cultural knowledge ob delivering ns in your org will be repeatedly lost. If yoi are constantly forming and breaking teams, you will not be able to deliver microservices beyond the simplistic,  non beneficial form ofbthe approach. Dont bother.  (Mention b&q example)

What a microservice funding scheme looks like, and how you should measure it.

Microservices are optimised for sustainable change. This means that in the medium to long term, you will br able to feasibly change yoir software, in ways that you wouldnt jave been able to.  They arent optimised for an initial rapid delivery effort. There are significant reasons why this woulsnt be the case.  You need cultural experience, to derive your own communication and api management approaches, api design styles. Tjia takes time. Primary development will be more expensive, and likely somewhat slower than a simple monolithic system.

The best way to deliver microservices therefore is to support this process. Construct teams that have a long term funding stream and keep them there. Early on, identify what is more important, rapid primary development, or long term sustainability. 
Lobg term funding fits an opex model. So, the most optimal funding approach for ms is long term operational funding. You are not funding a project,  you are establishing a capability, one that will be with you for a long time, all beimg well. 

If this concerns you, maybe you should ask more fundamental questions.  I've had push back on this before,  along the lines of "wr need to do lots of dev now, and then reduce the headcount". Well,  that speaks volumes! 

The first question i always ask in a microservices gig is "how will your system change". 
This gives a direct answer!  If you have large areas of the system that won't change, or will change at a similar rate, then dint botherto cut them apart at tje network level.  Leave them attached, they belong together.

Essentially, be selctive about what your microsevices are, based on how tou fund them. 

You can fund a minolith via capex. The only model that effetively works for microservices is long term opex commitment.
